## Motivations :mortar_board:

The goal of the project is to create **scanable T-shirts** that help you to break the ice in events with a lot of attendees like business events. By scanning other attendees T-shirts with the app you can find out informations about them that they are willing to share like their name, the langages they speak, their areas of expertise, etc...
These informations are displayed in a nice and friendly pop-up in **augmented reality**. 
We created an **identity layer** on a blockchain to give back the ownership of his information to the end user and allow interoperability between our identity layer and third party projects.


## Tech

This project heavily relies on augmented reality technology for the web. We used Aruco markers to relay the position of the attendy as well as his identity. All the data about the identity of the users are stored on the Ethereum and IPFS blockchains.
